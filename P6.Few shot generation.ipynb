If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times.  Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig has recently been making a frigid 150-mile walk through New Hampshire to promote campaign finance reform. Lessig the founder of the crowdfunded Mayday PAC -- known as the super-PAC to end all super-PACs -- kicked off the 10-day march in the tiny Northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch known for its midnight ballot box voting during the \"first in the nation\" primary. His walk will take him and dozens others to the state capitol in Concord by Jan. 21. In a visit to the Concord Monitor before starting the walk Lessig offered a striking comparison showing how the role of money in politics has changed over the years. To Lessig fundraising has become a primary focus for today’s politicians at the expense of governing. \"If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984 the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012 the answer is 228 times\" Lessig told the Monitor. He continued \"And you think how does a man as a person run the nation when he's attending 228 fundraisers? And the answer is not very well. It's pretty terrible for your ability to do your job. It's pretty terrible for your ability to be responsive to the American people because -- let me tell you -- the American people are not attending 228 fundraisers. Those people are different.\" It’s no secret that truckloads of dollars are raised and spent in presidential elections but PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered whether Lessig’s specific comparison between Reagan and Obama was accurate. Lessig isn’t the first to make the comparison between Reagan and Obama on fundraising; similar statistics have surfaced in various media reports. These comparisons track back to a distinction in campaign financing that we’ll recap here. The story begins in 1972 the year of President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign. (Yes the one that led to the Watergate scandal.) That year the Nixon re-election campaign collected millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. After Nixon’s resignation Congress passed (and Nixon’s successor as president Gerald Ford signed into law) changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Once enacted presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary up to $5 million. And for the general election candidates could secure full federal funding -- up to $20 million -- as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits. That system prevailed for the better part of three decades. However in recent presidential campaign cycles the system began to break down due to a combination of court decisions and changes in how presidential campaigns prefer to operate. An arms-race style competition between the parties has left any candidate who accepts the restrictions tied to federal funding at a severe disadvantage since candidates can easily raise more private money than the federal allotment without the strings attached. Obama is one of those politicians. He was the first president since Nixon to be elected with only private money. And to give some perspective on the amount of money we’re talking about more than $2 billion was raised and spent in the last presidential election between Obama and Mitt Romney. When we contacted Lessig to see where he was getting his data comparing Obama to Reagan he pointed to a presentation by Fred Wertheimer a lawyer and founder of Democracy 21 a group that advocates curbing the influence of big money in American politics. In his presentation -- made at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School in October 2012 -- Wertheimer said the system for public financing of presidential elections which emerged in the wake of the Watergate scandal is broken. Reagan used the public financing system for his campaign in 1984 and did not have a primary opponent eliminating his need to raise money during the primary and general election. Reagan \"ran for re-election without holding a single campaign fundraiser\" reported Washington Post national political editor Dan Eggen in a 2012 article \"Post-Watergate campaign finance limits undercut by changes.\" \"If he attended fundraisers they must have been for the party or for other GOP candidates\" concurred Viveca Novak the editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics which tracks money raised by politicians running for federal offices. Lessig later pointed to an article in the Baltimore Sun by Brendan Doherty -- a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of the book The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign. Doherty counted 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund compared to just three fundraisers \"headlined\" by Ronald Reagan during his third and fourth years in office leading up to his re-election. Doherty doesn’t break down the fundraisers year by year and instead uses a campaign cycle which usually spans two calendar years. His numbers match those cited by USA Today which reported on Aug. 12 2012 that Obama had attended his 200th fundraiser since filing for re-election in the spring of 2011. Obama attended five fundraisers in one day in Chicago including one at which guests paid $40000 per ticket according to the newspaper. Doherty counted the fundraisers by using the public papers of the presidents of the United States presidential libraries and Lexis-Nexis searches of Associated Press articles. \"My numbers are a bit different from the trend you cite but (the) shift from Reagan to Obama in terms of time spent fundraising has been dramatic\" Doherty told the Monitor. All told Reagan received about $40 million in public financing during his campaign -- while Obama raised more than $715 million in private funds. With the demise of the public financing system and looser rules on raising and spending money said Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics \"fundraising is unfortunately a bigger part of the process than ever before\" Novak said.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Lessig said Reagan attended eight fundraisers in 1984 while Obama attended 228 in the 2012 cycle. We couldn’t replicate his exact numbers but they jibe with reports by experts and the logic of how the public- and private-financing systems work. There’s certainly little doubt about Lessig’s larger point -- that there’s been a sea change in spending on presidential elections during the past 30 years.</td>\n",

And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify...It s horrible, the way we re treated. President Donald Trump often speaks of how other countries treat American products unfairly. At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan. It s called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is? Trump said, according to a recording obtained the Washington Post. That s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn t qualify. It s horrible, the way we re treated. It s horrible. The Washington Post noted, It was unclear what he was talking about. So we wanted to look into it. We asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking. However, we found something that loosely fits what he described. There are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan’s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what’s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It’s designed to measure the force someone’s head would absorb if a car hit them. This involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here’s a graphic from the agency’s website:  Note that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. So, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong. But those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong. When he said, If the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify, that would be a test of the strength of the hood. In contrast, the test is all about a person’s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident. It’s the complete opposite, said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety. In fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian. It’s akin to any other type of crash, Kane said. You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There’s a lot of crush, but that’s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people. A biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts. However, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers. It’s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent. The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years, said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood. Kane noted that the United States stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan. If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets, he said. If they don’t, that’s a business decision.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Says Rudy Giuliani bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine in early February. Rudy Giuliani’s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation. In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus. I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy, he said. Everything shows that it works. Giuliani’s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don’t know much about the drug’s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug. Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!! @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. ‘Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity &amp; the Trump family buy?’ (Screenshot from Twitter) The tweet was referred to us VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. We found the same claim circulating on Facebook, where some posts also implicated President Donald Trump. Novartis also paid Michael Cohen $1M in payments in 2016, one post reads, referring to Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney. Also Trump had a 1 on 1 meeting with Novartis CEO in January 2020. We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, so we wanted to take a closer look at Giuliani and Trump’s financial interests in the drugs and their manufacturers. We could find no evidence that Giuliani purchased stock in Novartis in early February. The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO. Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients. On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses the end of May. The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19. But the research is far from settled. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. With more than 50 studies still in the works, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is still unproven. Novartis has said criticism that the drug is unproven and the company is profiting from it is without merit. Now let’s take a closer look at any ties to Trump and his lawyers. While Novartis has paid Giuliani in the past, we could find no evidence that the former New York mayor has a current financial connection to the company. A search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information about publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Giuliani to Novartis. We also found no mention of Giuliani on the company’s website. A 2007 financial disclosure form from Giuliani, who campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, shows that Novartis paid him a $60,000 gross speaker fee on Feb. 6, 2006. The company is not listed anywhere else on the form. The New York Times reported that Giuliani’s interest in hydroxychloroquine stems in part from his contact with Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a New York physician who has been giving the drug to people with coronavirus-like symptoms. Giuliani told the Times he does not have any financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Novartis has had connections with another Trump associate. In May 2018, the company disclosed that it had paid Cohen, the former Trump personal attorney, for health care policy consulting. A Senate report published in July 2018 outlined how Cohen had received $1.2 million over a 12-month period ending in February 2018. A month after the deal was signed, Novartis determined he would not be able to provide the anticipated services, according to the report. However, Cohen was still paid for a year under the terms of the contract. In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. The connection between Cohen and Novartis has led some to speculate that Trump has financial motives for promoting hydroxychloroquine. Some Facebook users have claimed Trump met with the company one on one in January, making his recent promotion of the drug suspicious. There’s little evidence to back either claim up. Trump’s financial disclosure forms indicate that he has not held stock in Novartis since taking office. The last form filed was in May 2019. The New York Times reported that the president does have a stake in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund. But the stake is rather small; the Washington Post reported that it’s between about $100 and $1,500 in total. RELATED: Why experts worry about President Trump touting chloroquine As for the purported meeting between Trump and Novartis, there was a dinner the president attended with the company’s chairman — not its CEO — in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. The event included a slew of executives from other companies around the world. Even if Trump or his associates did have some stake in Novartis, it’s uncertain whether they’d reap financial benefits from the increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine. The company is donating, not selling, nearly its entire supply of the drug. Any rumors that Novartis stands to benefit financially or otherwise from the donation of hydroxychloroquine is without merit, a company spokesman told PolitiFact in an email. Novartis shares spiked briefly after Trump began touting chloroquine on March 19, but since then they have performed about as well as the broader stock market.</td>\n",
       "      <td>A tweet claimed that Rudy Giuliani bought $2 million in shares of Novartis in February. We could find no evidence that Giuliani has a current financial connection to Novartis, which has donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. The company did pay consulting fees to a former Trump associate, but documents don’t show any financial connection between the president himself and Novartis. The meeting that Trump had with the company’s chairman in January was not one on one — it included many other business executives. Bottom line: Available evidence does not show any financial link between Giuliani or Trump and Novartis. Barring additional evidence, the tweet is inaccurate.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Says Rudy Giuliani bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine in early February. Rudy Giuliani’s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation. In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus. I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy, he said. Everything shows that it works. Giuliani’s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don’t know much about the drug’s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug. Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!! @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. ‘Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity &amp; the Trump family buy?’ (Screenshot from Twitter) The tweet was referred to us VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. We found the same claim circulating on Facebook, where some posts also implicated President Donald Trump. Novartis also paid Michael Cohen $1M in payments in 2016, one post reads, referring to Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney. Also Trump had a 1 on 1 meeting with Novartis CEO in January 2020. We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, so we wanted to take a closer look at Giuliani and Trump’s financial interests in the drugs and their manufacturers. We could find no evidence that Giuliani purchased stock in Novartis in early February. The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO. Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients. On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses the end of May. The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19. But the research is far from settled.

Some Republicans have latched onto allegations about former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to bolster their narrative that President Barack Obama’s administration misused intelligence for political purposes. A few media sources, most prominently Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, have said Rice repeatedly asked to learn the names of unidentified American citizens who appeared in intelligence reports in connection to the Donald Trump campaign and transition. These reports are based on anonymous sources, and Rice has neither confirmed nor denied them. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Congress should investigate because if the story is true, it’s strange that someone in Rice’s White House position would request for names to be unmasked. \"You're right that it's not necessarily illegal,\" Cotton said in an April 4 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. \"It is unusual, though. The White House doesn't conduct criminal investigations. The White House doesn't conduct counterintelligence investigations. The White House is a consumer of intelligence. Normally, those kind of unmasking requests would be done by the agencies responsible for those activities.\" However, experts in intelligence collection and classified information told us it’s normal for someone in such a high-up national security role to make unmasking requests, and it would be hard, though not impossible, to abuse the practice for political purposes. \"It’s not unusual at all,\" said Joshua Rovner, chair of international politics and national security at Southern Methodist University and author of Fixing the Facts: National Security and the Politics of Intelligence.  We couldn’t find a way to quantify how often national security advisers or other White House officials make unmasking requests, but experts said it’s a routine, legitimate occurrence. The FBI and NSA regularly produce reports for government customers. The customer could be another investigating agency, Congress, the Justice Department or the White House. If an American’s name appears in a piece of intelligence — for example, if agents intercept a conversation between two foreign nationals who mention an American friend in passing — those preparing the report generally \"mask\" the American’s name, replacing it with something like \"U.S. Person.\" The recipient of the report might decide that in order to fully understand the intelligence, they need to know the \"U.S. Person’s\" identity. So they make a request for the name to be unmasked, and the agency that produced the report either approves or denies the request. The NSA approved 654 requests in 2015, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It’s not just agencies conducting criminal or counterintelligence investigations that make the unmasking requests, as Cotton said. It’s anyone who consumes intelligence reports. \"The national security adviser, who is a consumer of the most selective and restricted intelligence products, would certainly be entitled to request unmasking in the course of his or her duties,\" said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy. For example, a national security adviser might learn from an intelligence report that a foreign agent is trying to cultivate an unnamed U.S. official. They would need to know the official’s name in order to alert him or her in advance, or to get a full picture of the situation, Rovner said. ? Implied in Cotton’s statement is that Rice may have made unmasking requests for political purposes. The idea is that an official could use unmasking requests to surreptitiously dig up information about a U.S. citizen, such as a political opponent, without a warrant to surveil them. But experts said abusing the unmasking process would be difficult, in large part because the agency does the actual unmasking, not the requester. The official who wants to abuse the process would have to get agency workers on board with her plan because they would have to make sure she receives reports about the American in question. They would also have to make sure that any unmasking request would be granted, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty &amp; National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a civil liberties group. \"It’s certainly not an easy or direct route to spying on political opponents,\" she said, adding that there are other provisions of surveillance laws that are far more susceptible to abuse. Only a select group of high-up officials in the intelligence and national security communities have the authority to make or approve unmasking requests, and they have to do so while complying with an elaborate set of minimization guidelines, compliance procedures and documentation, said Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former NSA lawyer. These procedures, along with the intelligence community’s extreme sensitivity to accusations of political abuse, likely deters intelligence officials from complying with illegitimate unmasking requests, Rovner said. Hennessey added that the media reports about Rice are so inconsistent and vague that it’s not really possible to assess whether the unmasking requests in question (if they occurred) were legitimate.

That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record.  Cuomo did not make any distinction between convictions and arrests in his article. He just used the term 'criminal record' without defining it. The meaning of criminal record can be ambiguous. A search on the internet will tell you a criminal record is a history of someone’s convictions, a step beyond the FBI’s definition. \"When I teach my classes and I talk to my students about this, I tell them the term criminal record is almost useless,\" said Robert Brame, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. \"It could mean so many different things,\" Brame said. \"Are you talking about conviction record, arrest record, juvenile record?\" In most cases, arrests shouldn't show up on pre-employment checks, said Michelle Rodriguez, a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. \"But there's still mistakes that happen in background check reports so there is a possibility that something could show up,\" Rodriguez said. There is no federal data on the number of people with a criminal conviction living in the U.S. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics does have an estimate for how many people were under correctional supervision in 2015.

He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past. \"I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,\" he said in the video. He didn’t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn’t deserve to have the same voting power. Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: \"The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man’s. It’s what God intended.\" The YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes.

       "      <td>In a sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges.  In the wee hours of the morning of Oct. 1, 2013, as the House was engaged in a futile ping-pong match over averting the federal government shutdown, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, took to the floor to decry a \"sweetheart deal\" on health insurance for members of Congress. \"Mr. Speaker,\" Hensarling said, \"we are debating should members of Congress get a better deal than every other American in Obamacare? House Republicans say, ‘No, that’s not fair. That’s not equal protection under the law.’ Yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle (Democrats) are now saying, ‘No, no, no.’ They’re going to protect this sweetheart deal. ... \"Now members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. Is this fair, Mr. Speaker? I think not. Clearly, the other side of the aisle wants to preserve this special deal for Members of Congress granted by the President of the United States.\" Hensarling was referring to a provision of President Barack Obama’s health care law that was originally intended as a political maneuver by critics of the law. We asked his office for evidence to support his statement, but we didn't hear back. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring that lawmakers and their staffers obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for Congress. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. The problem arose in the drafting of the law. For most Americans who have employer-based insurance, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance. But the version of the health care bill signed into law doesn’t include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges, now called marketplaces. (Here’s a rundown of how this drafting error occurred.) Without a fix, congressional employees would have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. To fix this problem, the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources office, issued a ruling that allowed the same money that would have been spent on the employer’s old health insurance to instead be spent on whatever they purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. Obamacare critics have portrayed this as a special exemption to protect politically connected lawmakers and staff, one that was unavailable to the public at large. So some lawmakers backed an effort by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to revoke the employer’s premium cost-sharing for members of Congress, aides and other political appointees. As the House and Senate debated how to proceed to end the shutdown, passage of a funding bill with the Vitter Amendment attached was floated as a possibility. So that’s the background. Getting back to Hensarling’s statement, we see four claims embedded in  it: ? Hardly -- the tax credits commonly known as subsidies under Obamacare were being put into place starting Oct. 1, the same day the shutdown began. Anyone within a specified income range who purchases insurance on the Obamacare marketplace will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2017, about 24 million Americans will be buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces, many of them with federal subsidies. Only time will tell how many Americans eventually sign up, but it’s almost certainly going to be more than the roughly 30,000 people who work in the legislative branch. ? Not really. All lawmakers and many staffers won’t qualify for the subsidies we discussed above because their income is too high. Instead, what lawmakers and staff will qualify for is better described as employer cost-sharing -- an allotment of money that works exactly the same way as it does for the majority of Americans who get employer-based health care, and that long predated the beginning of the Obamacare exchanges. For Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance, the employer pays a share of the premiums. In this case, that \"employer\" is the federal government. ? Quite the opposite. Under the law as enacted, lawmakers and congressional aides are actually treated more harshly than any other American. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who have insurance will remain on their existing plans and see few if any disruptions. The marketplaces were created for Americans who lacked insurance entirely or had to buy insurance on their own, without employer assistance. By contrast, the law revokes the longstanding congressional health insurance arrangement and forces them into a new system, something not done for any other class of employee. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff \"particularly badly.\" The situation \"isn’t a ‘special handout’ for congressional employees. … People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience.\" An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. In short, the ability for congressional employees to keep their employer cost-share merely returns them to the already harsh provision that severs them from their existing health care plan. All the fix does is stop that provision from making even more trouble by forcing them to pay thousands of dollars more. We don’t think this qualifies as a \"sweetheart deal.\" ? The Obama administration isn’t entirely blameless -- in the rush to sign Obamacare into law, the president overlooked or ignored the problem looming in the legislative language, and his administration did approve the \"fix.\" Still, this controversy has been kept alive largely by Republicans, from the original Republican proposal to the Vitter amendment. So it’s at best a stretch to blame Obama.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hensarling said that in a \"sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges.\" This statement is wrong in almost every regard. Millions of ordinary Americans who currently lack health coverage are expected to get Obamacare subsidies in the years ahead. Congressional employees who purchase insurance on the marketplaces won’t be getting subsidies so much as they will be benefiting from a traditional employer cost-share, as many other Americans do. Far from getting a \"sweetheart deal,\" congressional employees would otherwise find themselves forced off their existing insurance plan, something the law itself does to no other employment group. And the issue has been largely driven by Republicans, not by the Obama administration. That’s a lot to get wrong in the space of a sentence or two.</td>\n",

       "      <td>UW-Madison spent down reserves as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has no more reserves to spend down.  The $300 million Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We can't handle this,\" UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. \"It's not good for the university. It's not good for the state. These are simply too big.\" We’ve established that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker’s 2015-’17 state budget. There’s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent. But what about the effect on UW-Madison, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)? At a Feb. 12, 2015 public meeting on Walker’s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament. \"As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut,\" Blank said. \"So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down.\" We’ll check both parts of Blank’s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison \"spent down reserves\" as it was told to, and now it has \"no more reserves to spend down.\"  Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in reserves. In fact-checking a claim by the system’s president at the time, we found the amount was roughly in line with some comparable university systems. Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged. The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so.  The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama’s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so. There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves. But, in effect, there was. The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-’15 state budget. They responded swiftly, instituting a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets. The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other. The UW System’s most recent assessment of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier.  The second part of Blank’s claim is UW-Madison has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" That’s an overstatement. Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as \"designated,\" \"planned\" or obligated\" -- that is, they are earmarked in some way. But Blank herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school describes as discretionary reserves -- \"fund balances not already committed to payments.\" In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That’s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget. On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker’s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn’t zero.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Blank says UW-Madison \"spent down reserves\" as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" With rhethoric and actions taken with the 2013-’15 state budget, Walker and the Legislature made it clear to UW-Madison and other UW System campuses that they needed to tap their reserves. And UW-Madison did. But Blank, objecting to even larger cuts in state aid now being proposed by Walker, goes too far in saying UW-Madison has no reserves, given that, at a minimum, $54 million in \"discretionary reserves\" are available. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.</td>\n",
       "      <td>UW-Madison spent down reserves as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has no more reserves to spend down. The $300 million Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We can't handle this,\" UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. \"It's not good for the university. It's not good for the state. These are simply too big.\" We’ve established that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker’s 2015-’17 state budget. There’s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent. But what about the effect on UW-Madison, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)? At a Feb. 12, 2015 public meeting on Walker’s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament. \"As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut,\" Blank said. \"So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down.\" We’ll check both parts of Blank’s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison \"spent down reserves\" as it was told to, and now it has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in reserves. In fact-checking a claim by the system’s president at the time, we found the amount was roughly in line with some comparable university systems. Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged. The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so. The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama’s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so. There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves. But, in effect, there was. The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-’15 state budget. They responded swiftly, instituting a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets. The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other. The UW System’s most recent assessment of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier. The second part of Blank’s claim is UW-Madison has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" That’s an overstatement. Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as \"designated,\" \"planned\" or obligated\" -- that is, they are earmarked in some way. But Blank herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school describes as discretionary reserves -- \"fund balances not already committed to payments.\" In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That’s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget. On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker’s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn’t zero.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent.  U2 frontman-turned social activist Bono took to the podium at the Munich Security Conference to make the case that the world’s richest economies would benefit from lifting up the poorest. The lack of jobs breeds extremism, he argued. \"You may not be interested in the trouble on a far-off street or across the Mediterranean on the other side of the globe, but let me assure you, that trouble is interested in you,\" Bono said. The singer-activist put education high on the list of where donors should put their money. \"We need a plan to make sure all girls can go to school -- 130 million girls around the world don't,\" Bono said. \"For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. Some studies even suggest that more education can reduce a country's risk of conflict by 20 percent.\" We wondered about the power of education to lift the incomes of women. Does each year of schooling actually lead to a 12 percent rise in earnings? According to the most recent research, it does. A 2014 study from the World Bank took data from 139 countries over a span of four decades and found that both men and women gain from going to school, and women gain more. \"When considering only males, the rate of return to another year of schooling is 9.6 percent, and for females the rate of returns is much higher, at 11.7 percent,\" the authors wrote. Their chart helps show the differences.  Bono’s press office at One, the advocacy organization he co-founded, told us this was the study behind his claim. The findings seem pretty clear, but we checked with Christina Kwauk, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington. Kwauk said not only is the average gain correct, but schooling continues to pay as women rise through the education system. \"Higher levels of education have even higher rates of return,\" she said. \"For example, an additional year of tertiary education is associated with nearly a 17 percent increase in income.\" Research also shows that gains are highest in low-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average increase is over 14 percent for women. That’s due in part to the very low starting point. It’s not totally clear why women gain more than men from education, but one theory is that women get a double advantage from going to school. Not only does it increase their skills -- as it does for a man -- but it also reduces the wage gap between men and women. So long as a society is open to hiring a woman for a higher paid job, her income bump will be larger compared to women with less education. A number of studies provide important caveats. They highlight that the quality of education matters, and simply finishing one year of schooling is not a guarantee that someone has learned as much as one might expect. Social attitudes also have an strong impact. If women are excluded from certain kinds of work, that will place a limit on their income gains.</td>\n",

A recent World Bank study based on numbers from more than a hundred countries found that the average woman gained 11.7 percent more in wages with each year of school.

       "6847    If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times.  Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig has recently been making a frigid 150-mile walk through New Hampshire to promote campaign finance reform. Lessig the founder of the crowdfunded Mayday PAC -- known as the super-PAC to end all super-PACs -- kicked off the 10-day march in the tiny Northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch known for its midnight ballot box voting during the \"first in the nation\" primary. His walk will take him and dozens others to the state capitol in Concord by Jan. 21. In a visit to the Concord Monitor before starting the walk Lessig offered a striking comparison showing how the role of money in politics has changed over the years. To Lessig fundraising has become a primary focus for today’s politicians at the expense of governing. \"If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984 the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012 the answer is 228 times\" Lessig told the Monitor. He continued \"And you think how does a man as a person run the nation when he's attending 228 fundraisers? And the answer is not very well. It's pretty terrible for your ability to do your job. It's pretty terrible for your ability to be responsive to the American people because -- let me tell you -- the American people are not attending 228 fundraisers. Those people are different.\" It’s no secret that truckloads of dollars are raised and spent in presidential elections but PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered whether Lessig’s specific comparison between Reagan and Obama was accurate. Lessig isn’t the first to make the comparison between Reagan and Obama on fundraising; similar statistics have surfaced in various media reports. These comparisons track back to a distinction in campaign financing that we’ll recap here. The story begins in 1972 the year of President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign. (Yes the one that led to the Watergate scandal.) That year the Nixon re-election campaign collected millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. After Nixon’s resignation Congress passed (and Nixon’s successor as president Gerald Ford signed into law) changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Once enacted presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary up to $5 million. And for the general election candidates could secure full federal funding -- up to $20 million -- as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits. That system prevailed for the better part of three decades. However in recent presidential campaign cycles the system began to break down due to a combination of court decisions and changes in how presidential campaigns prefer to operate. An arms-race style competition between the parties has left any candidate who accepts the restrictions tied to federal funding at a severe disadvantage since candidates can easily raise more private money than the federal allotment without the strings attached. Obama is one of those politicians. He was the first president since Nixon to be elected with only private money. And to give some perspective on the amount of money we’re talking about more than $2 billion was raised and spent in the last presidential election between Obama and Mitt Romney. When we contacted Lessig to see where he was getting his data comparing Obama to Reagan he pointed to a presentation by Fred Wertheimer a lawyer and founder of Democracy 21 a group that advocates curbing the influence of big money in American politics. In his presentation -- made at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School in October 2012 -- Wertheimer said the system for public financing of presidential elections which emerged in the wake of the Watergate scandal is broken. Reagan used the public financing system for his campaign in 1984 and did not have a primary opponent eliminating his need to raise money during the primary and general election. Reagan \"ran for re-election without holding a single campaign fundraiser\" reported Washington Post national political editor Dan Eggen in a 2012 article \"Post-Watergate campaign finance limits undercut by changes.\" \"If he attended fundraisers they must have been for the party or for other GOP candidates\" concurred Viveca Novak the editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics which tracks money raised by politicians running for federal offices. Lessig later pointed to an article in the Baltimore Sun by Brendan Doherty -- a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of the book The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign. Doherty counted 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund compared to just three fundraisers \"headlined\" by Ronald Reagan during his third and fourth years in office leading up to his re-election. Doherty doesn’t break down the fundraisers year by year and instead uses a campaign cycle which usually spans two calendar years. His numbers match those cited by USA Today which reported on Aug. 12 2012 that Obama had attended his 200th fundraiser since filing for re-election in the spring of 2011. Obama attended five fundraisers in one day in Chicago including one at which guests paid $40000 per ticket according to the newspaper. Doherty counted the fundraisers by using the public papers of the presidents of the United States presidential libraries and Lexis-Nexis searches of Associated Press articles. \"My numbers are a bit different from the trend you cite but (the) shift from Reagan to Obama in terms of time spent fundraising has been dramatic\" Doherty told the Monitor. All told Reagan received about $40 million in public financing during his campaign -- while Obama raised more than $715 million in private funds. With the demise of the public financing system and looser rules on raising and spending money said Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics \"fundraising is unfortunately a bigger part of the process than ever before\" Novak said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "10925   In Japan, they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify...It s horrible, the way we re treated. President Donald Trump often speaks of how other countries treat American products unfairly. At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan. It s called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is? Trump said, according to a recording obtained the Washington Post. That s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn t qualify. It s horrible, the way we re treated. It s horrible. The Washington Post noted, It was unclear what he was talking about. So we wanted to look into it. We asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking. However, we found something that loosely fits what he described. There are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan’s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what’s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It’s designed to measure the force someone’s head would absorb if a car hit them. This involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here’s a graphic from the agency’s website:  Note that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. So, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong. But those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong. When he said, If the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify, that would be a test of the strength of the hood. In contrast, the test is all about a person’s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident. It’s the complete opposite, said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety. In fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian. It’s akin to any other type of crash, Kane said. You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There’s a lot of crush, but that’s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people. A biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts. However, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers. It’s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent. The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years, said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood. Kane noted that the United States stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan. If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets, he said. If they don’t, that’s a business decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "7874    Says Rudy Giuliani bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine in early February. Rudy Giuliani’s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation. In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus. I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy, he said. Everything shows that it works. Giuliani’s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don’t know much about the drug’s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug. Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!! @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. ‘Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity & the Trump family buy?’ (Screenshot from Twitter) The tweet was referred to us VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. We found the same claim circulating on Facebook, where some posts also implicated President Donald Trump. Novartis also paid Michael Cohen $1M in payments in 2016, one post reads, referring to Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney. Also Trump had a 1 on 1 meeting with Novartis CEO in January 2020. We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, so we wanted to take a closer look at Giuliani and Trump’s financial interests in the drugs and their manufacturers. We could find no evidence that Giuliani purchased stock in Novartis in early February. The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO. Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients. On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses the end of May. The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19. But the research is far from settled. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. With more than 50 studies still in the works, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is still unproven. Novartis has said criticism that the drug is unproven and the company is profiting from it is without merit. Now let’s take a closer look at any ties to Trump and his lawyers. While Novartis has paid Giuliani in the past, we could find no evidence that the former New York mayor has a current financial connection to the company. A search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information about publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Giuliani to Novartis. We also found no mention of Giuliani on the company’s website. A 2007 financial disclosure form from Giuliani, who campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, shows that Novartis paid him a $60,000 gross speaker fee on Feb. 6, 2006. The company is not listed anywhere else on the form. The New York Times reported that Giuliani’s interest in hydroxychloroquine stems in part from his contact with Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a New York physician who has been giving the drug to people with coronavirus-like symptoms. Giuliani told the Times he does not have any financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Novartis has had connections with another Trump associate. In May 2018, the company disclosed that it had paid Cohen, the former Trump personal attorney, for health care policy consulting. A Senate report published in July 2018 outlined how Cohen had received $1.2 million over a 12-month period ending in February 2018. A month after the deal was signed, Novartis determined he would not be able to provide the anticipated services, according to the report. However, Cohen was still paid for a year under the terms of the contract. In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. The connection between Cohen and Novartis has led some to speculate that Trump has financial motives for promoting hydroxychloroquine. Some Facebook users have claimed Trump met with the company one on one in January, making his recent promotion of the drug suspicious. There’s little evidence to back either claim up. Trump’s financial disclosure forms indicate that he has not held stock in Novartis since taking office. The last form filed was in May 2019. The New York Times reported that the president does have a stake in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund. But the stake is rather small; the Washington Post reported that it’s between about $100 and $1,500 in total. RELATED: Why experts worry about President Trump touting chloroquine As for the purported meeting between Trump and Novartis, there was a dinner the president attended with the company’s chairman — not its CEO — in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. The event included a slew of executives from other companies around the world. Even if Trump or his associates did have some stake in Novartis, it’s uncertain whether they’d reap financial benefits from the increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine. The company is donating, not selling, nearly its entire supply of the drug. Any rumors that Novartis stands to benefit financially or otherwise from the donation of hydroxychloroquine is without merit, a company spokesman told PolitiFact in an email. Novartis shares spiked briefly after Trump began touting chloroquine on March 19, but since then they have performed about as well as the broader stock market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "10103   The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet.  U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., painted a dire portrait of China in his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying the country is \"trying to supplant us as the leading power in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Let me explain to you who the Chinese government is. The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet,\" Rubio said on March 14. \"The Chinese government will hold citizens prisoner without any right to recourse. The Chinese government coerces and tortures people until they get confessions from them.\"\\n\\nHe gave a few more examples of Chinese coercion before asking, \"We want that to be the leading country in the world?\" The crowd shouted \"No!\"\\n\\nWe wondered if Rubio was right about the Chinese government preventing its citizens from accessing the Internet.\\n\\nIt’s not.\\n\\nBy a wide margin, China leads the world in the sheer number of citizens accessing the Internet, with 538 million estimated users as of June 2012, according to Internet World Stats, which tracks Web use across the globe. The United States ranks second with about 245 million. About 40 percent of China’s population uses the Internet, placing it far below the penetration of many countries, including the U.S. at 78 percent. The major Internet providers in China are government-run telecom companies.\\n\\nRubio would have been on more solid ground if he said the Chinese government censors the Internet.\\n\\nAlthough people in China can access the Internet through home computers, Internet cafes and smartphones, they face some censorship, said Adam Segal, a fellow who specializes in technology and development in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an email. Access to a number of American and foreign websites is blocked or filtered, such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, but there are some Chinese equivalents.\\n\\n\"There can be very open discussion on Sina Weibo, which is a Twitter-like service,\" Segal said, \"though they are then censored if they become too sensitive.\"\\n\\nThe government blocked access to the New York Times and Bloomberg for reporting on the wealth of the family of prime minister Wen Jiabao. And after the 18th Communist Party Congress got its start in November 2012, all Google programs, including Gmail and its search engine, could not be accessed in the country.\\n\\nIn June 2012, Google unveiled on its Hong Kong-based search site a mechanism that identifies political and sensitive terms that may break the connection to Google, the Wall Street Journal reported. For example: the government has blocked the Chinese word for \"carrot\" which contains the character for Chinese President Hu Jintao’s surname.\\n\\nThe names of top leaders, dissidents and references to the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square protests can also be blocked. To avoid that censorship, some people in China have referred to the date of the protests as \"May 35th.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Times, all Internet traffic in China must pass through one of three computer centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, where computers known as the Great Firewall of China compare data with an updated list of keywords and Web address that are forbidden.\\n\\nSome Chinese users try to get around the firewall and access forbidden sites through virtual private networks or VPNs that essentially allow users to \"tunnel\" out of the country to avoid the censors, but China also cracked down on those services, which its Communist-affiliated daily newspaper called illegal.\\n\\nTwo years ago, the Beijing government clamped down on rules for microblogging, requiring users to register on sites like Sina Weibo with their real names, a move preventing anonymous commentary and criticism about the government and news events, according to the Wall Street Journal. In December 2012, the country’s congress adopted similar rules requiring Internet users to give their full names to service providers (while keeping pseudonyms on microblog posts) and Internet companies to report forbidden postings to the government, according to the Times.\\n\\n\"China has the world's most robust controls, both technical and human, on the Internet,\" David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project website, said in an email to PolitiFact. \"But this is by no means the full picture. Internet use is growing rapidly in the country, which currently has more than 570 million Internet users, 75 percent of which access the Internet on mobile devices.\"\\n\\nWhile many non-Chinese social media are blocked, homegrown versions are active allowing Chinese to even criticize authorities.\\n\\n\"It is a messy picture, and Chinese leaders are constantly struggling to balance control, which is still a major priority, with the growing public demand for information,\" Bandurski said.\\n\\nScott Edwards, an Amnesty International senior staffer based in Washington, D.C., said Rubio’s statement is up to a little bit of interpretation. Yes, the Chinese can access the Internet. But the government does not \"provide\" -- that’s the word Rubio used -- free and unfettered access. Plus, there is the undeniably wide divide in the country of access between the rich and poor. Internet use is also sometimes monitored, Edwards said.\\n\\nRubio’s comment touches on the debate of the free Internet movement, Edwards said, which calls on the government to provide access to the Internet and that the government should not be interfering. In a policy that was even backed by China, the United Nations Human Rights Council affirmed that freedom of expression online is a basic human right.\\n\\nWe emailed Rubio’s press team for comment and did not hear back.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "11308   It is unusual for a White House official like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to make unmasking requests.  Some Republicans have latched onto allegations about former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to bolster their narrative that President Barack Obama’s administration misused intelligence for political purposes. A few media sources, most prominently Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, have said Rice repeatedly asked to learn the names of unidentified American citizens who appeared in intelligence reports in connection to the Donald Trump campaign and transition. These reports are based on anonymous sources, and Rice has neither confirmed nor denied them. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Congress should investigate because if the story is true, it’s strange that someone in Rice’s White House position would request for names to be unmasked. \"You're right that it's not necessarily illegal,\" Cotton said in an April 4 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. \"It is unusual, though. The White House doesn't conduct criminal investigations. The White House doesn't conduct counterintelligence investigations. The White House is a consumer of intelligence. Normally, those kind of unmasking requests would be done by the agencies responsible for those activities.\" However, experts in intelligence collection and classified information told us it’s normal for someone in such a high-up national security role to make unmasking requests, and it would be hard, though not impossible, to abuse the practice for political purposes. \"It’s not unusual at all,\" said Joshua Rovner, chair of international politics and national security at Southern Methodist University and author of Fixing the Facts: National Security and the Politics of Intelligence.  We couldn’t find a way to quantify how often national security advisers or other White House officials make unmasking requests, but experts said it’s a routine, legitimate occurrence. The FBI and NSA regularly produce reports for government customers. The customer could be another investigating agency, Congress, the Justice Department or the White House. If an American’s name appears in a piece of intelligence — for example, if agents intercept a conversation between two foreign nationals who mention an American friend in passing — those preparing the report generally \"mask\" the American’s name, replacing it with something like \"U.S. Person.\" The recipient of the report might decide that in order to fully understand the intelligence, they need to know the \"U.S. Person’s\" identity. So they make a request for the name to be unmasked, and the agency that produced the report either approves or denies the request. The NSA approved 654 requests in 2015, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It’s not just agencies conducting criminal or counterintelligence investigations that make the unmasking requests, as Cotton said. It’s anyone who consumes intelligence reports. \"The national security adviser, who is a consumer of the most selective and restricted intelligence products, would certainly be entitled to request unmasking in the course of his or her duties,\" said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy. For example, a national security adviser might learn from an intelligence report that a foreign agent is trying to cultivate an unnamed U.S. official. They would need to know the official’s name in order to alert him or her in advance, or to get a full picture of the situation, Rovner said. ? Implied in Cotton’s statement is that Rice may have made unmasking requests for political purposes. The idea is that an official could use unmasking requests to surreptitiously dig up information about a U.S. citizen, such as a political opponent, without a warrant to surveil them. But experts said abusing the unmasking process would be difficult, in large part because the agency does the actual unmasking, not the requester. The official who wants to abuse the process would have to get agency workers on board with her plan because they would have to make sure she receives reports about the American in question. They would also have to make sure that any unmasking request would be granted, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a civil liberties group. \"It’s certainly not an easy or direct route to spying on political opponents,\" she said, adding that there are other provisions of surveillance laws that are far more susceptible to abuse. Only a select group of high-up officials in the intelligence and national security communities have the authority to make or approve unmasking requests, and they have to do so while complying with an elaborate set of minimization guidelines, compliance procedures and documentation, said Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former NSA lawyer. These procedures, along with the intelligence community’s extreme sensitivity to accusations of political abuse, likely deters intelligence officials from complying with illegitimate unmasking requests, Rovner said. Hennessey added that the media reports about Rice are so inconsistent and vague that it’s not really possible to assess whether the unmasking requests in question (if they occurred) were legitimate. But \"I have not seen anything in the public record that indicates there is any kind of problem here,\" she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "4184    70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants businesses in New York state to hire more applicants with a criminal record. They become loyal employees and bring tax benefits, he said. And, they make up a huge pool of prospective employees. \"70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults,\" Cuomo wrote in an article on career website LinkedIn. People with a criminal record number too many for employers to pass over because of unsubstantiated fears of workplace violence, theft or incompetence, he said. But is the number as high as he said? Does one in every three adults have a criminal record?  The FBI considers anyone who has been arrested on a felony charge to have a criminal record, even if the arrest did not lead to a conviction. The FBI only counts those with a misdemeanor if a state agency asks the bureau to keep it on file. So by the FBI’s standard, 73.5 million people in the United States had a criminal record as of June 30. The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record.  Cuomo did not make any distinction between convictions and arrests in his article. He just used the term 'criminal record' without defining it. The meaning of criminal record can be ambiguous. A search on the internet will tell you a criminal record is a history of someone’s convictions, a step beyond the FBI’s definition. \"When I teach my classes and I talk to my students about this, I tell them the term criminal record is almost useless,\" said Robert Brame, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. \"It could mean so many different things,\" Brame said. \"Are you talking about conviction record, arrest record, juvenile record?\" In most cases, arrests shouldn't show up on pre-employment checks, said Michelle Rodriguez, a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. \"But there's still mistakes that happen in background check reports so there is a possibility that something could show up,\" Rodriguez said. There is no federal data on the number of people with a criminal conviction living in the U.S. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics does have an estimate for how many people were under correctional supervision in 2015. The bureau reported 6.7 million adults either incarcerated or on parole or probation. That’s close to three out of every 100 adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7879    Says U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho said African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote.  A viral image on Facebook falsely accused U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., of saying black Americans should only have three-fifths of a vote. A curious reader pointed us to the image, which reads: \"This guy is Republican Florida Representative Ted Yoho who said this week that African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida.\" We looked into it and found that there’s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme’s creator was duped by a satirical website. We learned the image was from a Facebook user in California named Mark Kusler, who based it on a story on Politicalo.com. The website posts some real news, but it also posts satirical stories with exaggerated content. The site includes a \"Show Facts\" button that allow readers to highlight which parts of their stories are true and which are not. But the viral image — which has been shared more than 3,000 times — does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what’s the real story? On May 20, 2014, liberal website RightWingWatch.org ran a story about video footage from a stop at Berean Baptist Church in Ocala during Yoho’s 2012 congressional campaign (not last week, as the image said). During the appearance, Yoho blasted allowing an uninformed electorate into polling places and decried early voting through absentee ballots. He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past. \"I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,\" he said in the video. He didn’t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn’t deserve to have the same voting power. Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: \"The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man’s. It’s what God intended.\" The YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes. An administrator from Politicalo pointed out to PolitiFact Florida that the quote was not highlighted by the \"Show Facts\" button, meaning it was fabricated by the post’s writer. People For the American Way, the parent of Right Wing Watch, confirmed to us that Yoho didn't say the things Politicalo added. That’s not to say Yoho’s comment about voters historically being property owners didn’t face some backlash. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that Yoho’s assertions \"harken back to another century when Americans were denied their basic rights as citizens\" and \"should be roundly condemned in the strongest possible terms.\" Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told MSNBC in an email that \"the congressman was making a reference to how voting was structured when America was in its infancy (from a historical perspective). He does not believe that this is the way it should be now.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "8854    In a sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges.  In the wee hours of the morning of Oct. 1, 2013, as the House was engaged in a futile ping-pong match over averting the federal government shutdown, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, took to the floor to decry a \"sweetheart deal\" on health insurance for members of Congress. \"Mr. Speaker,\" Hensarling said, \"we are debating should members of Congress get a better deal than every other American in Obamacare? House Republicans say, ‘No, that’s not fair. That’s not equal protection under the law.’ Yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle (Democrats) are now saying, ‘No, no, no.’ They’re going to protect this sweetheart deal. ... \"Now members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. Is this fair, Mr. Speaker? I think not. Clearly, the other side of the aisle wants to preserve this special deal for Members of Congress granted by the President of the United States.\" Hensarling was referring to a provision of President Barack Obama’s health care law that was originally intended as a political maneuver by critics of the law. We asked his office for evidence to support his statement, but we didn't hear back. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring that lawmakers and their staffers obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for Congress. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. The problem arose in the drafting of the law. For most Americans who have employer-based insurance, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance. But the version of the health care bill signed into law doesn’t include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges, now called marketplaces. (Here’s a rundown of how this drafting error occurred.) Without a fix, congressional employees would have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. To fix this problem, the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources office, issued a ruling that allowed the same money that would have been spent on the employer’s old health insurance to instead be spent on whatever they purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. Obamacare critics have portrayed this as a special exemption to protect politically connected lawmakers and staff, one that was unavailable to the public at large. So some lawmakers backed an effort by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to revoke the employer’s premium cost-sharing for members of Congress, aides and other political appointees. As the House and Senate debated how to proceed to end the shutdown, passage of a funding bill with the Vitter Amendment attached was floated as a possibility. So that’s the background. Getting back to Hensarling’s statement, we see four claims embedded in  it: ? Hardly -- the tax credits commonly known as subsidies under Obamacare were being put into place starting Oct. 1, the same day the shutdown began. Anyone within a specified income range who purchases insurance on the Obamacare marketplace will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2017, about 24 million Americans will be buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces, many of them with federal subsidies. Only time will tell how many Americans eventually sign up, but it’s almost certainly going to be more than the roughly 30,000 people who work in the legislative branch. ? Not really. All lawmakers and many staffers won’t qualify for the subsidies we discussed above because their income is too high. Instead, what lawmakers and staff will qualify for is better described as employer cost-sharing -- an allotment of money that works exactly the same way as it does for the majority of Americans who get employer-based health care, and that long predated the beginning of the Obamacare exchanges. For Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance, the employer pays a share of the premiums. In this case, that \"employer\" is the federal government. ? Quite the opposite. Under the law as enacted, lawmakers and congressional aides are actually treated more harshly than any other American. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who have insurance will remain on their existing plans and see few if any disruptions. The marketplaces were created for Americans who lacked insurance entirely or had to buy insurance on their own, without employer assistance. By contrast, the law revokes the longstanding congressional health insurance arrangement and forces them into a new system, something not done for any other class of employee. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff \"particularly badly.\" The situation \"isn’t a ‘special handout’ for congressional employees. … People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience.\" An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. In short, the ability for congressional employees to keep their employer cost-share merely returns them to the already harsh provision that severs them from their existing health care plan. All the fix does is stop that provision from making even more trouble by forcing them to pay thousands of dollars more. We don’t think this qualifies as a \"sweetheart deal.\" ? The Obama administration isn’t entirely blameless -- in the rush to sign Obamacare into law, the president overlooked or ignored the problem looming in the legislative language, and his administration did approve the \"fix.\" Still, this controversy has been kept alive largely by Republicans, from the original Republican proposal to the Vitter amendment. So it’s at best a stretch to blame Obama.    \n",
       "7131    UW-Madison spent down reserves as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has no more reserves to spend down.  The $300 million Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We can't handle this,\" UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. \"It's not good for the university. It's not good for the state. These are simply too big.\" We’ve established that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker’s 2015-’17 state budget. There’s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent. But what about the effect on UW-Madison, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)? At a Feb. 12, 2015 public meeting on Walker’s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament. \"As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut,\" Blank said. \"So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down.\" We’ll check both parts of Blank’s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison \"spent down reserves\" as it was told to, and now it has \"no more reserves to spend down.\"  Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in reserves. In fact-checking a claim by the system’s president at the time, we found the amount was roughly in line with some comparable university systems. Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged. The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so.  The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama’s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so. There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves. But, in effect, there was. The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-’15 state budget. They responded swiftly, instituting a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets. The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other. The UW System’s most recent assessment of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier.  The second part of Blank’s claim is UW-Madison has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" That’s an overstatement. Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as \"designated,\" \"planned\" or obligated\" -- that is, they are earmarked in some way. But Blank herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school describes as discretionary reserves -- \"fund balances not already committed to payments.\" In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That’s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget. On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker’s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn’t zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2183    For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent.  U2 frontman-turned social activist Bono took to the podium at the Munich Security Conference to make the case that the world’s richest economies would benefit from lifting up the poorest. The lack of jobs breeds extremism, he argued. \"You may not be interested in the trouble on a far-off street or across the Mediterranean on the other side of the globe, but let me assure you, that trouble is interested in you,\" Bono said. The singer-activist put education high on the list of where donors should put their money. \"We need a plan to make sure all girls can go to school -- 130 million girls around the world don't,\" Bono said. \"For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. Some studies even suggest that more education can reduce a country's risk of conflict by 20 percent.\" We wondered about the power of education to lift the incomes of women. Does each year of schooling actually lead to a 12 percent rise in earnings? According to the most recent research, it does. A 2014 study from the World Bank took data from 139 countries over a span of four decades and found that both men and women gain from going to school, and women gain more. \"When considering only males, the rate of return to another year of schooling is 9.6 percent, and for females the rate of returns is much higher, at 11.7 percent,\" the authors wrote. Their chart helps show the differences.  Bono’s press office at One, the advocacy organization he co-founded, told us this was the study behind his claim. The findings seem pretty clear, but we checked with Christina Kwauk, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington. Kwauk said not only is the average gain correct, but schooling continues to pay as women rise through the education system. \"Higher levels of education have even higher rates of return,\" she said. \"For example, an additional year of tertiary education is associated with nearly a 17 percent increase in income.\" Research also shows that gains are highest in low-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average increase is over 14 percent for women. That’s due in part to the very low starting point. It’s not totally clear why women gain more than men from education, but one theory is that women get a double advantage from going to school. Not only does it increase their skills -- as it does for a man -- but it also reduces the wage gap between men and women. So long as a society is open to hiring a woman for a higher paid job, her income bump will be larger compared to women with less education. A number of studies provide important caveats. They highlight that the quality of education matters, and simply finishing one year of schooling is not a guarantee that someone has learned as much as one might expect. Social attitudes also have an strong impact. If women are excluded from certain kinds of work, that will place a limit on their income gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "6847    Lessig said Reagan attended eight fundraisers in 1984 while Obama attended 228 in the 2012 cycle. We couldn’t replicate his exact numbers but they jibe with reports by experts and the logic of how the public- and private-financing systems work. There’s certainly little doubt about Lessig’s larger point -- that there’s been a sea change in spending on presidential elections during the past 30 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "10925  Trump said that in Japan, they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify. American cars must meet a Japanese standard. But Trump mangled the highly controlled process, which does not involve a bowling ball dropped from 20 feet. Where Trump really goes astray is on the purpose of the test; he has it backward. It’s not about seeing if the hood is strong. The more a hood gives way, the better it is for the head of a pedestrian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "7874   A tweet claimed that Rudy Giuliani bought $2 million in shares of Novartis in February. We could find no evidence that Giuliani has a current financial connection to Novartis, which has donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. The company did pay consulting fees to a former Trump associate, but documents don’t show any financial connection between the president himself and Novartis. The meeting that Trump had with the company’s chairman in January was not one on one — it included many other business executives. Bottom line: Available evidence does not show any financial link between Giuliani or Trump and Novartis. Barring additional evidence, the tweet is inaccurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "11308   Cotton said, \"It is unusual\" for a White House official like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to make unmasking requests. As the president’s top consultant on issues of national security, Rice and other national security advisers consume a large amount of intelligence. There are numerous legitimate reasons why Rice might ask an intelligence agency to reveal the identity of an unnamed person in an intelligence report.

       "4184    Cuomo said \"70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults.\" By the FBI definition, that is correct. But the term ‘criminal record’ is ambiguous, and the FBI definition is different from the common-sense definition. His claim may have been interpreted by some to mean one-third of adults have a criminal conviction. His statement leaves out how he defines criminal record, an important detail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "7879    A viral image said Yoho said \"African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote.\" There is no evidence Yoho said anything specifically about black voters in a 2012 campaign appearance in Ocala. The image was taken from a satirical news story on a satire site that twisted Yoho’s words about voting rights to make him appear biased against black voters. While Yoho has talked about reducing early voting, the post goes too far in using a fake quote to make it appear the congressman wants to strip away African Americans' civil rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8854    Hensarling said that in a \"sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges.\" This statement is wrong in almost every regard. Millions of ordinary Americans who currently lack health coverage are expected to get Obamacare subsidies in the years ahead. Congressional employees who purchase insurance on the marketplaces won’t be getting subsidies so much as they will be benefiting from a traditional employer cost-share, as many other Americans do. Far from getting a \"sweetheart deal,\" congressional employees would otherwise find themselves forced off their existing insurance plan, something the law itself does to no other employment group. And the issue has been largely driven by Republicans, not by the Obama administration. That’s a lot to get wrong in the space of a sentence or two.   \n",
       "7131    Blank says UW-Madison \"spent down reserves\" as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" With rhethoric and actions taken with the 2013-’15 state budget, Walker and the Legislature made it clear to UW-Madison and other UW System campuses that they needed to tap their reserves. And UW-Madison did. But Blank, objecting to even larger cuts in state aid now being proposed by Walker, goes too far in saying UW-Madison has no reserves, given that, at a minimum, $54 million in \"discretionary reserves\" are available. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2183    Bono said that for every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. A recent World Bank study based on numbers from more than a hundred countries found that the average woman gained 11.7 percent more in wages with each year of school. Rounding up to 12 percent seems fair. These gains can vary both up and down, depending on the country, but that’s the nature of an average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "6847   If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times. Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig has recently been making a frigid 150-mile walk through New Hampshire to promote campaign finance reform. Lessig the founder of the crowdfunded Mayday PAC -- known as the super-PAC to end all super-PACs -- kicked off the 10-day march in the tiny Northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch known for its midnight ballot box voting during the \"first in the nation\" primary. His walk will take him and dozens others to the state capitol in Concord by Jan. 21. In a visit to the Concord Monitor before starting the walk Lessig offered a striking comparison showing how the role of money in politics has changed over the years. To Lessig fundraising has become a primary focus for today’s politicians at the expense of governing. \"If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984 the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012 the answer is 228 times\" Lessig told the Monitor. He continued \"And you think how does a man as a person run the nation when he's attending 228 fundraisers? And the answer is not very well. It's pretty terrible for your ability to do your job. It's pretty terrible for your ability to be responsive to the American people because -- let me tell you -- the American people are not attending 228 fundraisers. Those people are different.\" It’s no secret that truckloads of dollars are raised and spent in presidential elections but PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered whether Lessig’s specific comparison between Reagan and Obama was accurate. Lessig isn’t the first to make the comparison between Reagan and Obama on fundraising; similar statistics have surfaced in various media reports. These comparisons track back to a distinction in campaign financing that we’ll recap here. The story begins in 1972 the year of President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign. (Yes the one that led to the Watergate scandal.) That year the Nixon re-election campaign collected millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. After Nixon’s resignation Congress passed (and Nixon’s successor as president Gerald Ford signed into law) changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Once enacted presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary up to $5 million. And for the general election candidates could secure full federal funding -- up to $20 million -- as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits. That system prevailed for the better part of three decades. However in recent presidential campaign cycles the system began to break down due to a combination of court decisions and changes in how presidential campaigns prefer to operate. An arms-race style competition between the parties has left any candidate who accepts the restrictions tied to federal funding at a severe disadvantage since candidates can easily raise more private money than the federal allotment without the strings attached. Obama is one of those politicians. He was the first president since Nixon to be elected with only private money. And to give some perspective on the amount of money we’re talking about more than $2 billion was raised and spent in the last presidential election between Obama and Mitt Romney. When we contacted Lessig to see where he was getting his data comparing Obama to Reagan he pointed to a presentation by Fred Wertheimer a lawyer and founder of Democracy 21 a group that advocates curbing the influence of big money in American politics. In his presentation -- made at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School in October 2012 -- Wertheimer said the system for public financing of presidential elections which emerged in the wake of the Watergate scandal is broken. Reagan used the public financing system for his campaign in 1984 and did not have a primary opponent eliminating his need to raise money during the primary and general election. Reagan \"ran for re-election without holding a single campaign fundraiser\" reported Washington Post national political editor Dan Eggen in a 2012 article \"Post-Watergate campaign finance limits undercut by changes.\" \"If he attended fundraisers they must have been for the party or for other GOP candidates\" concurred Viveca Novak the editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics which tracks money raised by politicians running for federal offices. Lessig later pointed to an article in the Baltimore Sun by Brendan Doherty -- a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of the book The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign. Doherty counted 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund compared to just three fundraisers \"headlined\" by Ronald Reagan during his third and fourth years in office leading up to his re-election. Doherty doesn’t break down the fundraisers year by year and instead uses a campaign cycle which usually spans two calendar years. His numbers match those cited by USA Today which reported on Aug. 12 2012 that Obama had attended his 200th fundraiser since filing for re-election in the spring of 2011. Obama attended five fundraisers in one day in Chicago including one at which guests paid $40000 per ticket according to the newspaper. Doherty counted the fundraisers by using the public papers of the presidents of the United States presidential libraries and Lexis-Nexis searches of Associated Press articles. \"My numbers are a bit different from the trend you cite but (the) shift from Reagan to Obama in terms of time spent fundraising has been dramatic\" Doherty told the Monitor. All told Reagan received about $40 million in public financing during his campaign -- while Obama raised more than $715 million in private funds. With the demise of the public financing system and looser rules on raising and spending money said Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics \"fundraising is unfortunately a bigger part of the process than ever before\" Novak said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "10925  In Japan, they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify...It s horrible, the way we re treated. President Donald Trump often speaks of how other countries treat American products unfairly. At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan. It s called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is? Trump said, according to a recording obtained the Washington Post. That s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn t qualify. It s horrible, the way we re treated. It s horrible. The Washington Post noted, It was unclear what he was talking about. So we wanted to look into it. We asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking. However, we found something that loosely fits what he described. There are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan’s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what’s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It’s designed to measure the force someone’s head would absorb if a car hit them. This involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here’s a graphic from the agency’s website: Note that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. So, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong. But those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong. When he said, If the hood dents, then the car doesn t qualify, that would be a test of the strength of the hood. In contrast, the test is all about a person’s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident. It’s the complete opposite, said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety. In fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian. It’s akin to any other type of crash, Kane said. You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There’s a lot of crush, but that’s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people. A biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts. However, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers. It’s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent. The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years, said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood. Kane noted that the United States stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan. If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets, he said. If they don’t, that’s a business decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "7874   Says Rudy Giuliani bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine in early February. Rudy Giuliani’s promotion of a lupus and arthritis drug to treat COVID-19 patients is raising eyebrows about his motivation. In an interview with Fox News on April 5, Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, said hydroxychloroquine could potentially be used to alleviate symptoms associated with the coronavirus. I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy, he said. Everything shows that it works. Giuliani’s comments echo what Trump has said over the past few weeks, despite the fact that medical experts still don’t know much about the drug’s efficacy against COVID-19. (Not every study shows that it works, for instance.) But a tweet published the same day as the Fox interview claims Giuliani has ulterior motives for promoting the drug. Here @whpresscorps Ask Trump about THIS!! @Wiseronenow said in the tweet. ‘Giuliani, in early February, bought $2M in shares of Novartis, a primary supplier of hydroxychloroquine. How many shares did Sean Hannity & the Trump family buy?’ (Screenshot from Twitter) The tweet was referred to us VineSight, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. We found the same claim circulating on Facebook, where some posts also implicated President Donald Trump. Novartis also paid Michael Cohen $1M in payments in 2016, one post reads, referring to Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney. Also Trump had a 1 on 1 meeting with Novartis CEO in January 2020. We’ve seen a lot of misinformation about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, so we wanted to take a closer look at Giuliani and Trump’s financial interests in the drugs and their manufacturers. We could find no evidence that Giuliani purchased stock in Novartis in early February. The company paid Cohen more than $1 million in consulting fees in 2017, not 2016. And while Trump did attend a dinner with a Novartis leader in January, it was not a one-on-one meeting with the CEO. Novartis is a Swiss pharmaceutical company. It has donated hydroxychloroquine to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile for use in treating COVID-19 patients. On March 29, the Department of Health and Human Services published a statement saying that it had accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated Sandoz, the generics division of Novartis. The company said in an earlier press release that it plans to give out 130 million doses the end of May. The donation came after Trump said during a March 19 press briefing that chloroquine could potentially be used to treat COVID-19. But the research is far from settled. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. With more than 50 studies still in the works, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is still unproven. Novartis has said criticism that the drug is unproven and the company is profiting from it is without merit. Now let’s take a closer look at any ties to Trump and his lawyers. While Novartis has paid Giuliani in the past, we could find no evidence that the former New York mayor has a current financial connection to the company. A search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database, which contains information about publicly traded companies, turned up no documents linking Giuliani to Novartis. We also found no mention of Giuliani on the company’s website. A 2007 financial disclosure form from Giuliani, who campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, shows that Novartis paid him a $60,000 gross speaker fee on Feb. 6, 2006. The company is not listed anywhere else on the form. The New York Times reported that Giuliani’s interest in hydroxychloroquine stems in part from his contact with Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a New York physician who has been giving the drug to people with coronavirus-like symptoms. Giuliani told the Times he does not have any financial interests in hydroxychloroquine. We reached out to him for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Novartis has had connections with another Trump associate. In May 2018, the company disclosed that it had paid Cohen, the former Trump personal attorney, for health care policy consulting. A Senate report published in July 2018 outlined how Cohen had received $1.2 million over a 12-month period ending in February 2018. A month after the deal was signed, Novartis determined he would not be able to provide the anticipated services, according to the report. However, Cohen was still paid for a year under the terms of the contract. In December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. The connection between Cohen and Novartis has led some to speculate that Trump has financial motives for promoting hydroxychloroquine. Some Facebook users have claimed Trump met with the company one on one in January, making his recent promotion of the drug suspicious. There’s little evidence to back either claim up. Trump’s financial disclosure forms indicate that he has not held stock in Novartis since taking office. The last form filed was in May 2019. The New York Times reported that the president does have a stake in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund. But the stake is rather small; the Washington Post reported that it’s between about $100 and $1,500 in total. RELATED: Why experts worry about President Trump touting chloroquine As for the purported meeting between Trump and Novartis, there was a dinner the president attended with the company’s chairman — not its CEO — in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21. The event included a slew of executives from other companies around the world. Even if Trump or his associates did have some stake in Novartis, it’s uncertain whether they’d reap financial benefits from the increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine. The company is donating, not selling, nearly its entire supply of the drug. Any rumors that Novartis stands to benefit financially or otherwise from the donation of hydroxychloroquine is without merit, a company spokesman told PolitiFact in an email. Novartis shares spiked briefly after Trump began touting chloroquine on March 19, but since then they have performed about as well as the broader stock market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "10103  The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., painted a dire portrait of China in his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying the country is \"trying to supplant us as the leading power in the world.\"  \"Let me explain to you who the Chinese government is. The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet,\" Rubio said on March 14. \"The Chinese government will hold citizens prisoner without any right to recourse. The Chinese government coerces and tortures people until they get confessions from them.\"  He gave a few more examples of Chinese coercion before asking, \"We want that to be the leading country in the world?\" The crowd shouted \"No!\"  We wondered if Rubio was right about the Chinese government preventing its citizens from accessing the Internet.  It’s not.  By a wide margin, China leads the world in the sheer number of citizens accessing the Internet, with 538 million estimated users as of June 2012, according to Internet World Stats, which tracks Web use across the globe. The United States ranks second with about 245 million. About 40 percent of China’s population uses the Internet, placing it far below the penetration of many countries, including the U.S. at 78 percent. The major Internet providers in China are government-run telecom companies.  Rubio would have been on more solid ground if he said the Chinese government censors the Internet.  Although people in China can access the Internet through home computers, Internet cafes and smartphones, they face some censorship, said Adam Segal, a fellow who specializes in technology and development in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an email. Access to a number of American and foreign websites is blocked or filtered, such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, but there are some Chinese equivalents.  \"There can be very open discussion on Sina Weibo, which is a Twitter-like service,\" Segal said, \"though they are then censored if they become too sensitive.\"  The government blocked access to the New York Times and Bloomberg for reporting on the wealth of the family of prime minister Wen Jiabao. And after the 18th Communist Party Congress got its start in November 2012, all Google programs, including Gmail and its search engine, could not be accessed in the country.  In June 2012, Google unveiled on its Hong Kong-based search site a mechanism that identifies political and sensitive terms that may break the connection to Google, the Wall Street Journal reported. For example: the government has blocked the Chinese word for \"carrot\" which contains the character for Chinese President Hu Jintao’s surname.  The names of top leaders, dissidents and references to the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square protests can also be blocked. To avoid that censorship, some people in China have referred to the date of the protests as \"May 35th.\"  According to the Times, all Internet traffic in China must pass through one of three computer centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, where computers known as the Great Firewall of China compare data with an updated list of keywords and Web address that are forbidden.  Some Chinese users try to get around the firewall and access forbidden sites through virtual private networks or VPNs that essentially allow users to \"tunnel\" out of the country to avoid the censors, but China also cracked down on those services, which its Communist-affiliated daily newspaper called illegal.  Two years ago, the Beijing government clamped down on rules for microblogging, requiring users to register on sites like Sina Weibo with their real names, a move preventing anonymous commentary and criticism about the government and news events, according to the Wall Street Journal. In December 2012, the country’s congress adopted similar rules requiring Internet users to give their full names to service providers (while keeping pseudonyms on microblog posts) and Internet companies to report forbidden postings to the government, according to the Times.  \"China has the world's most robust controls, both technical and human, on the Internet,\" David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project website, said in an email to PolitiFact. \"But this is by no means the full picture. Internet use is growing rapidly in the country, which currently has more than 570 million Internet users, 75 percent of which access the Internet on mobile devices.\"  While many non-Chinese social media are blocked, homegrown versions are active allowing Chinese to even criticize authorities.  \"It is a messy picture, and Chinese leaders are constantly struggling to balance control, which is still a major priority, with the growing public demand for information,\" Bandurski said.  Scott Edwards, an Amnesty International senior staffer based in Washington, D.C., said Rubio’s statement is up to a little bit of interpretation. Yes, the Chinese can access the Internet. But the government does not \"provide\" -- that’s the word Rubio used -- free and unfettered access. Plus, there is the undeniably wide divide in the country of access between the rich and poor. Internet use is also sometimes monitored, Edwards said.  Rubio’s comment touches on the debate of the free Internet movement, Edwards said, which calls on the government to provide access to the Internet and that the government should not be interfering. In a policy that was even backed by China, the United Nations Human Rights Council affirmed that freedom of expression online is a basic human right.  We emailed Rubio’s press team for comment and did not hear back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "11308  It is unusual for a White House official like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to make unmasking requests. Some Republicans have latched onto allegations about former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to bolster their narrative that President Barack Obama’s administration misused intelligence for political purposes. A few media sources, most prominently Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, have said Rice repeatedly asked to learn the names of unidentified American citizens who appeared in intelligence reports in connection to the Donald Trump campaign and transition. These reports are based on anonymous sources, and Rice has neither confirmed nor denied them. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Congress should investigate because if the story is true, it’s strange that someone in Rice’s White House position would request for names to be unmasked. \"You're right that it's not necessarily illegal,\" Cotton said in an April 4 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. \"It is unusual, though. The White House doesn't conduct criminal investigations. The White House doesn't conduct counterintelligence investigations. The White House is a consumer of intelligence. Normally, those kind of unmasking requests would be done by the agencies responsible for those activities.\" However, experts in intelligence collection and classified information told us it’s normal for someone in such a high-up national security role to make unmasking requests, and it would be hard, though not impossible, to abuse the practice for political purposes. \"It’s not unusual at all,\" said Joshua Rovner, chair of international politics and national security at Southern Methodist University and author of Fixing the Facts: National Security and the Politics of Intelligence. We couldn’t find a way to quantify how often national security advisers or other White House officials make unmasking requests, but experts said it’s a routine, legitimate occurrence. The FBI and NSA regularly produce reports for government customers. The customer could be another investigating agency, Congress, the Justice Department or the White House. If an American’s name appears in a piece of intelligence — for example, if agents intercept a conversation between two foreign nationals who mention an American friend in passing — those preparing the report generally \"mask\" the American’s name, replacing it with something like \"U.S. Person.\" The recipient of the report might decide that in order to fully understand the intelligence, they need to know the \"U.S. Person’s\" identity. So they make a request for the name to be unmasked, and the agency that produced the report either approves or denies the request. The NSA approved 654 requests in 2015, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It’s not just agencies conducting criminal or counterintelligence investigations that make the unmasking requests, as Cotton said. It’s anyone who consumes intelligence reports. \"The national security adviser, who is a consumer of the most selective and restricted intelligence products, would certainly be entitled to request unmasking in the course of his or her duties,\" said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy. For example, a national security adviser might learn from an intelligence report that a foreign agent is trying to cultivate an unnamed U.S. official. They would need to know the official’s name in order to alert him or her in advance, or to get a full picture of the situation, Rovner said. ? Implied in Cotton’s statement is that Rice may have made unmasking requests for political purposes. The idea is that an official could use unmasking requests to surreptitiously dig up information about a U.S. citizen, such as a political opponent, without a warrant to surveil them. But experts said abusing the unmasking process would be difficult, in large part because the agency does the actual unmasking, not the requester. The official who wants to abuse the process would have to get agency workers on board with her plan because they would have to make sure she receives reports about the American in question. They would also have to make sure that any unmasking request would be granted, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a civil liberties group. \"It’s certainly not an easy or direct route to spying on political opponents,\" she said, adding that there are other provisions of surveillance laws that are far more susceptible to abuse. Only a select group of high-up officials in the intelligence and national security communities have the authority to make or approve unmasking requests, and they have to do so while complying with an elaborate set of minimization guidelines, compliance procedures and documentation, said Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former NSA lawyer. These procedures, along with the intelligence community’s extreme sensitivity to accusations of political abuse, likely deters intelligence officials from complying with illegitimate unmasking requests, Rovner said. Hennessey added that the media reports about Rice are so inconsistent and vague that it’s not really possible to assess whether the unmasking requests in question (if they occurred) were legitimate. But \"I have not seen anything in the public record that indicates there is any kind of problem here,\" she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "4184   70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults. Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants businesses in New York state to hire more applicants with a criminal record. They become loyal employees and bring tax benefits, he said. And, they make up a huge pool of prospective employees. \"70 million Americans have a criminal record — that’s one in three adults,\" Cuomo wrote in an article on career website LinkedIn. People with a criminal record number too many for employers to pass over because of unsubstantiated fears of workplace violence, theft or incompetence, he said. But is the number as high as he said? Does one in every three adults have a criminal record? The FBI considers anyone who has been arrested on a felony charge to have a criminal record, even if the arrest did not lead to a conviction. The FBI only counts those with a misdemeanor if a state agency asks the bureau to keep it on file. So by the FBI’s standard, 73.5 million people in the United States had a criminal record as of June 30. The Census Bureau lists the adult population in the United States at 249.4 million. That means the FBI considers about 29.5 percent of adults to have a criminal record. Cuomo did not make any distinction between convictions and arrests in his article. He just used the term 'criminal record' without defining it. The meaning of criminal record can be ambiguous. A search on the internet will tell you a criminal record is a history of someone’s convictions, a step beyond the FBI’s definition. \"When I teach my classes and I talk to my students about this, I tell them the term criminal record is almost useless,\" said Robert Brame, a professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina. \"It could mean so many different things,\" Brame said. \"Are you talking about conviction record, arrest record, juvenile record?\" In most cases, arrests shouldn't show up on pre-employment checks, said Michelle Rodriguez, a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. \"But there's still mistakes that happen in background check reports so there is a possibility that something could show up,\" Rodriguez said. There is no federal data on the number of people with a criminal conviction living in the U.S. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics does have an estimate for how many people were under correctional supervision in 2015. The bureau reported 6.7 million adults either incarcerated or on parole or probation. That’s close to three out of every 100 adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "7879   Says U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho said African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. A viral image on Facebook falsely accused U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., of saying black Americans should only have three-fifths of a vote. A curious reader pointed us to the image, which reads: \"This guy is Republican Florida Representative Ted Yoho who said this week that African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida.\" We looked into it and found that there’s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme’s creator was duped by a satirical website. We learned the image was from a Facebook user in California named Mark Kusler, who based it on a story on Politicalo.com. The website posts some real news, but it also posts satirical stories with exaggerated content. The site includes a \"Show Facts\" button that allow readers to highlight which parts of their stories are true and which are not. But the viral image — which has been shared more than 3,000 times — does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what’s the real story? On May 20, 2014, liberal website RightWingWatch.org ran a story about video footage from a stop at Berean Baptist Church in Ocala during Yoho’s 2012 congressional campaign (not last week, as the image said). During the appearance, Yoho blasted allowing an uninformed electorate into polling places and decried early voting through absentee ballots. He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past. \"I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote,\" he said in the video. He didn’t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn’t deserve to have the same voting power. Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: \"The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man’s. It’s what God intended.\" The YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes. An administrator from Politicalo pointed out to PolitiFact Florida that the quote was not highlighted by the \"Show Facts\" button, meaning it was fabricated by the post’s writer. People For the American Way, the parent of Right Wing Watch, confirmed to us that Yoho didn't say the things Politicalo added. That’s not to say Yoho’s comment about voters historically being property owners didn’t face some backlash. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that Yoho’s assertions \"harken back to another century when Americans were denied their basic rights as citizens\" and \"should be roundly condemned in the strongest possible terms.\" Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told MSNBC in an email that \"the congressman was making a reference to how voting was structured when America was in its infancy (from a historical perspective). He does not believe that this is the way it should be now.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "8854   In a sweetheart deal … members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. In the wee hours of the morning of Oct. 1, 2013, as the House was engaged in a futile ping-pong match over averting the federal government shutdown, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, took to the floor to decry a \"sweetheart deal\" on health insurance for members of Congress. \"Mr. Speaker,\" Hensarling said, \"we are debating should members of Congress get a better deal than every other American in Obamacare? House Republicans say, ‘No, that’s not fair. That’s not equal protection under the law.’ Yet, our friends on the other side of the aisle (Democrats) are now saying, ‘No, no, no.’ They’re going to protect this sweetheart deal. ... \"Now members of Congress, thanks to the Obama administration, are going to be the only people in America to get subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. Is this fair, Mr. Speaker? I think not. Clearly, the other side of the aisle wants to preserve this special deal for Members of Congress granted by the President of the United States.\" Hensarling was referring to a provision of President Barack Obama’s health care law that was originally intended as a political maneuver by critics of the law. We asked his office for evidence to support his statement, but we didn't hear back. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring that lawmakers and their staffers obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for Congress. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. The problem arose in the drafting of the law. For most Americans who have employer-based insurance, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance. But the version of the health care bill signed into law doesn’t include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges, now called marketplaces. (Here’s a rundown of how this drafting error occurred.) Without a fix, congressional employees would have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. To fix this problem, the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources office, issued a ruling that allowed the same money that would have been spent on the employer’s old health insurance to instead be spent on whatever they purchased on the Obamacare marketplaces. Obamacare critics have portrayed this as a special exemption to protect politically connected lawmakers and staff, one that was unavailable to the public at large. So some lawmakers backed an effort by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to revoke the employer’s premium cost-sharing for members of Congress, aides and other political appointees. As the House and Senate debated how to proceed to end the shutdown, passage of a funding bill with the Vitter Amendment attached was floated as a possibility. So that’s the background. Getting back to Hensarling’s statement, we see four claims embedded in  it: ? Hardly -- the tax credits commonly known as subsidies under Obamacare were being put into place starting Oct. 1, the same day the shutdown began. Anyone within a specified income range who purchases insurance on the Obamacare marketplace will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2017, about 24 million Americans will be buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces, many of them with federal subsidies. Only time will tell how many Americans eventually sign up, but it’s almost certainly going to be more than the roughly 30,000 people who work in the legislative branch. ? Not really. All lawmakers and many staffers won’t qualify for the subsidies we discussed above because their income is too high. Instead, what lawmakers and staff will qualify for is better described as employer cost-sharing -- an allotment of money that works exactly the same way as it does for the majority of Americans who get employer-based health care, and that long predated the beginning of the Obamacare exchanges. For Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance, the employer pays a share of the premiums. In this case, that \"employer\" is the federal government. ? Quite the opposite. Under the law as enacted, lawmakers and congressional aides are actually treated more harshly than any other American. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who have insurance will remain on their existing plans and see few if any disruptions. The marketplaces were created for Americans who lacked insurance entirely or had to buy insurance on their own, without employer assistance. By contrast, the law revokes the longstanding congressional health insurance arrangement and forces them into a new system, something not done for any other class of employee. Even the National Review, the conservative magazine that is none too fond of Obamacare, recently wrote that the provision treats lawmakers and staff \"particularly badly.\" The situation \"isn’t a ‘special handout’ for congressional employees. … People who happen to be paid by the federal treasury don’t deserve to have the entire value of their existing coverage stripped away, as almost no Americans will experience.\" An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. In short, the ability for congressional employees to keep their employer cost-share merely returns them to the already harsh provision that severs them from their existing health care plan. All the fix does is stop that provision from making even more trouble by forcing them to pay thousands of dollars more. We don’t think this qualifies as a \"sweetheart deal.\" ? The Obama administration isn’t entirely blameless -- in the rush to sign Obamacare into law, the president overlooked or ignored the problem looming in the legislative language, and his administration did approve the \"fix.\" Still, this controversy has been kept alive largely by Republicans, from the original Republican proposal to the Vitter amendment. So it’s at best a stretch to blame Obama.   \n",
       "7131   UW-Madison spent down reserves as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has no more reserves to spend down. The $300 million Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"We can't handle this,\" UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. \"It's not good for the university. It's not good for the state. These are simply too big.\" We’ve established that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker’s 2015-’17 state budget. There’s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent. But what about the effect on UW-Madison, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)? At a Feb. 12, 2015 public meeting on Walker’s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament. \"As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut,\" Blank said. \"So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down.\" We’ll check both parts of Blank’s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison \"spent down reserves\" as it was told to, and now it has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in reserves. In fact-checking a claim by the system’s president at the time, we found the amount was roughly in line with some comparable university systems. Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged. The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so. The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama’s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so. There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves. But, in effect, there was. The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-’15 state budget. They responded swiftly, instituting a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets. The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other. The UW System’s most recent assessment of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier. The second part of Blank’s claim is UW-Madison has \"no more reserves to spend down.\" That’s an overstatement. Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as \"designated,\" \"planned\" or obligated\" -- that is, they are earmarked in some way. But Blank herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school describes as discretionary reserves -- \"fund balances not already committed to payments.\" In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That’s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget. On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker’s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn’t zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2183   For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. U2 frontman-turned social activist Bono took to the podium at the Munich Security Conference to make the case that the world’s richest economies would benefit from lifting up the poorest. The lack of jobs breeds extremism, he argued. \"You may not be interested in the trouble on a far-off street or across the Mediterranean on the other side of the globe, but let me assure you, that trouble is interested in you,\" Bono said. The singer-activist put education high on the list of where donors should put their money. \"We need a plan to make sure all girls can go to school -- 130 million girls around the world don't,\" Bono said. \"For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. Some studies even suggest that more education can reduce a country's risk of conflict by 20 percent.\" We wondered about the power of education to lift the incomes of women. Does each year of schooling actually lead to a 12 percent rise in earnings? According to the most recent research, it does. A 2014 study from the World Bank took data from 139 countries over a span of four decades and found that both men and women gain from going to school, and women gain more. \"When considering only males, the rate of return to another year of schooling is 9.6 percent, and for females the rate of returns is much higher, at 11.7 percent,\" the authors wrote. Their chart helps show the differences. Bono’s press office at One, the advocacy organization he co-founded, told us this was the study behind his claim. The findings seem pretty clear, but we checked with Christina Kwauk, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington. Kwauk said not only is the average gain correct, but schooling continues to pay as women rise through the education system. \"Higher levels of education have even higher rates of return,\" she said. \"For example, an additional year of tertiary education is associated with nearly a 17 percent increase in income.\" Research also shows that gains are highest in low-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average increase is over 14 percent for women. That’s due in part to the very low starting point. It’s not totally clear why women gain more than men from education, but one theory is that women get a double advantage from going to school. Not only does it increase their skills -- as it does for a man -- but it also reduces the wage gap between men and women. So long as a society is open to hiring a woman for a higher paid job, her income bump will be larger compared to women with less education. A number of studies provide important caveats. They highlight that the quality of education matters, and simply finishing one year of schooling is not a guarantee that someone has learned as much as one might expect. Social attitudes also have an strong impact. If women are excluded from certain kinds of work, that will place a limit on their income gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "6847   Lessig’s comparison between Reagan and Obama is accurate. In 1972 the Nixon re-election campaign raised millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions to the federal Election Campaign Act. After Nixon’s departure from office the Watergate scandal led to his re-election campaign. Then again in 2012 the same year lessig made a 150-mile walk through New Hampshire. If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984 the answer is eight. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012 the answer is 228 times. Lessig’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.  \n",
